# Impact of Music on Mental Health

Overview: 

This is a R-based project where a logistic regression model was fitted to demonstrate the relation between music and mental health. In this project, a dataset with 737 rows 
of observations was collected from online resources to help us accomplish the model fitting. By the end of this project, we will be able to conclude the performance of the 
statistical model in terms of predicting the impact of music on mental health of people based on their personal information, music preferences, and self-reported mental health.

Processes:
1. Before fitting a model, we perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get an insight of the characteristics of data.
2. After a full model was built, AIC, BIC, and LASSO were used for model selection to obtain a reduced/simplified model with a better prediction performance.
3. Once the final model has been decided, Cross Validation, ROC, DFBETAS, and Deviance Residual are adopted to measure the overall prediction accuracy of the model.

Finally:

We interpreted the model statistically and illustrated any limitations in this project.
